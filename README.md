git clone https://github.com/Caldegorn/SuiTestnet.git
cd SuiTestnet
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If `requirements.txt` is not present, the script likely uses only standard libraries.)*

## Usage
